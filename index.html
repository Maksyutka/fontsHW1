                <span>T</span> his happened, indeed, to the train in which Mr. Fogg was travelling. About twelve o'clock
                a troop of ten
                or
                twelve thousand head of buffalo <br> encumbered the track. The locomotive, slackening its speed, tried
                to
                clear
                the way with its cow–catcher; but the mass of animals was too great. The <br> buffaloes marched along
                with a
                tranquil gait, uttering now and then deafening <br> bellowings. There was no use of interrupting them,
                for,
                having taken a particular direction, nothing can moderate and change their course; it is a torrent <br>
                of
                living
                flesh which no dam could contain. <br>
                <br>
                The travellers gazed on this curious spectacle from the platforms; but
                Phileas Fogg, who had the most reason of all to be in a hurry, remained in his <br> seat, and waited
                philosophically until it should please the buffaloes to get out of the way. <br> Passepartout was
                furious at
                the
                delay they occasioned, and longed to discharge his arsenal of revolvers upon them. <br>
                <br>
                "What a
                country!"
                cried
                he. "Mere cattle stop the trains, and go by in a procession, just as if they were not impeding travel!
                Parbleu! I should like to <br> know if Mr. Fogg foresaw this mishap in his programme! And here's an
                engineer
                who
                doesn't dare to run the locomotive into this herd of beasts!" <br>
            <div class="subtitleStyle"><span>“ </span> The engineer did not try to overcome the obstacle, and he was
                wise.</div>
